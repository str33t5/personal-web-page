      <li><p>Then we got the mk4 toyota supra. This outstanding car was in 1993 and productions lasted till 2002 so their kind've rare and I like them as much as the newer versions of the supra.</p></li>

      <li><p> Now the jaguar f type, I love the logo they have but espically on the older models since its a unique outstanding logo however this model and the year built doesnt come with that type of logo however its still a beautiful and fast sports car and has an amazing interior inside too. And I love the sleek design it has.</p></li>

      <li><p> And last but not least, the dodge hellcat challenger srt. I love the way the engine sounds on this car. Its fast and has real good design to it and I love its "launch" button that it has which I think is a cool feature.</p></li>
    </ol>
